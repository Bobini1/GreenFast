# Green - FAST
Game created purely to train my first game AI on. Turned out to be actually pretty fun.

Game is pretty simple - Get to the Green - FAST.
Also:
- Avoid touching any red circles.
- Everything completely randomized. Your speed, size, opponents, obstacles, playfield
- You only have 5 seconds for each level.
- No pause, only quit.
- ***R A V E*** ~~*(nothing like a fresh youtube-stolen earrape-boosted music)*~~
- *"Nice."*
- *"Oof."*
- 1 point rule: Win - Plus 1 point. Lose - Minus 1 point.
- Game gets significantly harder with each point gained.

How many points can you get?
